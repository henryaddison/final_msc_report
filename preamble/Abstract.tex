  This project uses agent-based modelling to explore rowing on a busy river like the Cam in Cambridge. A model of the behaviour of coxes and boats is designed and a simulation implemented in computer code. This simulation is used to evaluate possible sets of logical rules that could be used by coxes, both real and simulated, to govern their behaviour.

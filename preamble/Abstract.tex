  This project uses agent-based modelling to explore rowing on a busy river like the Cam in Cambridge. The creation of a computer simulation is described from the design an agent-based model of coxes and boats to the implementation done with the aid of the Repast Simphony agent-based modelling software framework. Possible sets of logical rules that could be used by coxes, both real and simulated, to govern their behaviour are evaluated using the simulation.

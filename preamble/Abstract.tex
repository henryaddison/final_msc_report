  This project studies rowing traffic on a busy river. It describes the creation of a computer simulation. An agent-based model of river, boats and coxes is created. The river is turned into lanes constructed as directed graphs with nodes representing points on the river and edges connecting adjacent points in the lane. The nodes are picked so that each is about a boat length from its neighbour. The coxes are intelligent agents controlling the boats. A cox's decision process uses rules sets expressed as teleo-reactive programs. The model is implemented with the aid of the Repast Simphony agent-based modelling software framework. Possible sets of logical rules that could be used by coxes, both real and simulated, to govern their behaviour are evaluated using the simulation.

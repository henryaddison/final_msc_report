\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Acknowledgements}

I'd like to thank Dr. Krysia Broda for supervising this project. Her help throughout has been invaluable. 

My thanks also go to Dr. Francesca Toni for agreeing to be my second marker.

Ed Manley, EngD student at UCL, was a helpful guide who got me started with agent-based modelling software.

This project is the culmination of my MSc year at Imperial College London. I could not have achieved so much without the excellent teaching and facilities available here in the Department of Computing. Past colleagues have also been great sources of wisdom as I learn the art of computer programming.

Finally I'd like to thank my family and Alice for all their support.

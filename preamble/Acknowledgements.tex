I'd like to thank Dr. Krysia Broda for supervising this project. Her help throughout has been invaluable. My thanks also go to Dr. Francesca Toni for agreeing to be my second marker.

Ed Manley, EngD student at UCL, was a helpful guide who got me started with agent-based modelling software.

This project is the culmination of my MSc year at Imperial College London. I would not have achieved so much without the excellent teaching I have received from so many in the Department of Computing.

Past colleagues have also been great sources of wisdom as I learn the art of computer programming. In particular, Paul Butcher was an excellent mentor and Frederick Cheung a friend who forces me to discover so much as I try to keep up.

Finally I'd like to thank my family and Alice for all their support.

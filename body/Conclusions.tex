\chapter{Conclusions}\label{chapter:conclusions}
  This chapter takes a look at what was achieved during the past few months working on this project. It also gives some suggestions for how the project could be extended in the future and some other uses for the model and software.
  
  \section{What I achieved}
  I created an agent-based model of cox and boat behaviour on a narrow river that was described in Chapter \ref{chapter:model}. Chapters \ref{chapter:technicalissues}, \ref{chapter:softwaredesign} and \ref{chapter:control_policy} describe how the model was implemented in software to produce a computer simulation of coxes and boat on an approximation of the Cam. The software also contained a framework for running and collecting data from the simulation. Chapter \ref{chapter:experiments} show how this was used to test the suitability of different control policies under different starting conditions.
  
  The results in Chapter \ref{chapter:experiments} did not give a clear winner in all three fields of outing completion, safety and sticking to the outing plan. A cox who is too cautious and hangs back behind a slow boat may avoid crashing but he will not stick well to his outing plan and may spend more time on the river than his crew can spare. On the other hand a cox who tries to stick to his outing plan and ignores other boats will crash too often to maintain his desired speed. The rules for overtaking slower boats appear to be the most important as they allow a boat to be safe and a cox to stick to his outing plan. 
  
  Of the policies tested, I recommend the Overtaking policy. It is the only policy that performs well in all three measures. It successfully gets boats back to the boathouse whilst sticking most closely to the cox's desired gear. Although following this policy results in more crashes than the SafetyFocussed policy, it is not vastly more crashes and the SafetyFocussed policy performs much worse when comparing how well the policy allows a cox to stick to his desired gear.
  
  The deeper dive into the crash results suggested the control policies written so far are not making optimal use of the space available on the river. This highlights another use of the software. It is straight-forward to drop in another control policy class and by sticking to the teleo-reactive format the application could form the basis of a logic teaching tool. It is fun writing new policies and the experiment framework makes it easy to measure their performance under different launch schedules.
  
  \subsection{Improved policy based on results}
  One possible control policy, SaferOvertaking, that might work better than the current lot can be found in Appendix \ref{appendix:code} in Listing \ref{listing:safer_overtaking}. The current Overtaking policy performs better than the GearFocussed policy at sticking the desired gear and much better when it comes to crash counts. However, compared to the SafetyFocussed policy, the Overtaking has room to improve on the safety front but is much better at sticking to the desired gear. 
  
  Therefore it makes sense to sacrifice some of the Overtaking policies sticking to gear ability in favour of extra safety. One way to achieve this trade-off is to prevent boats, which are faster than the boat in front but cannot change lanes (either because there's no space to the left or because they are not going sufficiently fast enough to risk overtaking), from crashing into that slower boat in front and instead to have them slow down as the SafetyFocussed policy does. This policy also shows how one might go about getting the cox's to look ahead and behind different distances. 
  
  There is a danger that this editing of the Overtaking policy might back-fire. It could lead to a set of faster boats who get to overtake and a set of slower boats which form long conveys to be overtaken. This would lead to the faster boats being in the middle lane for a long time and therefore result in many more high-speed head-on collisions. Even if this is not a problem, it is impossible to tell how much safety is improved and how much outing plan deviation is worsened by looking at the program. It is for reasons such as these that new policies must be tested carefully even if they may appear on paper to be thoroughly sensible.
  
  \section{Further work}
  With such a short time to complete this project, it is inevitable that further improvements to the model, the software and its evaluation are possible. Chapters \ref{chapter:model}, \ref{chapter:softwaredesign}, \ref{chapter:control_policy} and \ref{chapter:experiments} all have sections at the end listing future work that could be done. I will now pick out the items from those sections that I would most like to see done next.
  
  I believe that improvements to the lane model to allow lanes to branch and merge (see section \ref{model:future:lane} in Model chapter) would be useful work. This would remove the assumption that the river has constant width and would allow the simulation of many more types of river - in particular, it would make it possible to have a much closer approximation of the Cam.
  
  The control policies written for this project all have very distinct. My next preference would be to apply machine learning techniques to create new control policies (see section \ref{control:future:machinelearnt} in Control Policies chapter). It would be fascinating to see what rules it comes up with and whether any of those rules could be applied on to the actual Cam to improve traffic flow and safety.
  
  After that I would like to model launch schedules which match more closely the traffic conditions of the Cam (see \ref{model:future:launch_schedule} in Model chapter). However, I fear that this work may require a lot of time and the reward be only personal satisfaction (I cannot see large EPSRC grants being awarded to fund such an endeavour).
  
  \section{Other applications of the software}
  This project took rowing on the river Cam as its inspiration. However, there are other uses for the model and software. It would be very easy to alter the software to simulation traffic on another river.
  
  More radical departures from the original source are also possible. The model and software could be applied to other areas with lanes. It could even be adapted so that the lanes are not even physically adjacent. Simulating cars on motorways, ships in shipping lanes or aircraft on flight paths spring to mind.

  \section{Closing Remarks}
  On a personal level I am very proud of this project and the software produced as part of it. It has been a fascinating introduction to agent-based modelling and teleo-reactive programs. It has given me the opportunity to build a computer simulation and use it to evaluate intelligent agents. It has given me experience of technologies such as the Java programming language and SQL databases.
  
  I believe this project has been a success. I have created a valid model and computer simulation of rowing boats on a narrow and busy river. The simulation has proved useful to suggest a policy easily understandable by anyone that could help to ease congestion, reduce collisions and enable boats to follow the training plans set by their coaches. I have also provided pointers to anyone who might wish to improve or adapt the model and software in the future.

\section{Overview of experiments run}
  
  \paragraph{Parameters changed each run}
  
  \subsection{Details looked at in each experiment}
    \paragraph{Single boat}
  
    \paragraph{Getting boats back to boat house}
    
    \paragraph{Crashes}
    
    \paragraph{Deviation from desired gear}

\section{Single boat}
  \paragraph{which ones made it back}
  \paragraph{values of gear difference}
    
\section{Getting boats back to boat house}
  \paragraph{Table of \% of each time of brain that got back to boat house}
  
  \paragraph{RandomChoice bad, exclude from rest of experiments}
  
  \paragraph{Rough equivalence of remaining brains}
  
  \paragraph{Table for how percentages changed with schedule}
  
  \paragraph{See that the 10 minute delay is to blame - not all boats launched, no chance for later boats to get back to boat house no matter how good their control policy}
  
  \paragraph{Table of overall percentages excluding 10 minute dealy}
  
  \paragraph{Interestingly RandomMovement is best, though BasicBrain and Overtaking brain hardly significant variation. Unsurprisingly Conservative is worst}
  
\section{Crashes}
  \paragraph{graphs of crash no versus delay between boats for varying brains and numbers of boats}
  
  \paragraph{Conservative brain is best, unsurprisingly. Reassuring the overtaking brain is better than basic brain - there is an advantage in looking ahead for obstacles. Random movement unsurprisingly bad - with basic brains, faster boats should gradually filter to the front}
  
\section{Deviation from desired gear}

@article{Nguyen-Tuong2011,
abstract = {Models are among the most essential tools in robotics, such as kinematics and dynamics models of the robot's own body and controllable external objects. It is widely believed that intelligent mammals also rely on internal models in order to generate their actions. However, while classical robotics relies on manually generated models that are based on human insights into physics, future autonomous, cognitive robots need to be able to automatically generate models that are based on information which is extracted from the data streams accessible to the robot. In this paper, we survey the progress in model learning with a strong focus on robot control on a kinematic as well as dynamical level. Here, a model describes essential information about the behavior of the environment and the influence of an agent on this environment. In the context of model-based learning control, we view the model from three different perspectives. First, we need to study the different possible model learning architectures for robotics. Second, we discuss what kind of problems these architecture and the domain of robotics imply for the applicable learning methods. From this discussion, we deduce future directions of real-time learning algorithms. Third, we show where these scenarios have been used successfully in several case studies.},
annote = {More detail (\& technical terms) than is necessary for this project (or at least that I can cope with yet). But useufl ideas about different forms of model a robot could learn and learning and regression techniques they could use. Plus reassuring that learnig for robot control is very much an open issue. The idea of not having to pre-program all possible scenarios is very powerful (not least because pre-programmed, analytic solutions may be difficult/impossible to obtain).},

@article{Allan2009,
abstract = {Agent Based Modelling and Simulation is a computationally demanding technique having itsorigins in discrete event simulation, genetic algorithms and cellular automata. It is a powerful technique for simulating dynamic complex systems and observing "emergent" behaviour. There is currently a lot of interest in developing ABMs as a general computational technique applicable to the study of large scale systems. ABMs has been adapted to run on novel architectures such as GPGPU, e.g. nVidia hardware using the CUDA programming language. Argonne National Laboratory have a Web site on Exascale ABMs and have run models on the IBM BlueGene with funding from the SciDAC Programme. The most common uses of ABMs are in social simulation and optimisation problems, such as crowd behaviour, urban simulation, traffic flow and supply chains. We will investigate other uses in computational science, particularly in engineering and systems biology.},

The control strategy for the robot is derived, using an evolutionary algorithm, from a continuous improvement of machine language programs which are varied and selected against each other. We give an overview of our recent work on several fundamental behaviors like obstacle avoidance and object following adapted from programs that were originally random sequences of commands. It is argued that the method is generally applicable where there is a need for quick adaptation within real-time problem domains},

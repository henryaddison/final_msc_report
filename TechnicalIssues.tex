  \section{Building the river}
    \subsection{Rastorization vs vectorization}
      \paragraph{Storing river as a series of squares/pixels}
      \paragraph{Storing river as a series of vectors (or nodes separated by vectors)}
      \paragraph{Breaking down river into 1D lanes adds benefits to vectorization}

  \section{Action execution}
    \subsection{Ensuring misuse of action does not break system}
      \paragraph{Making sure actions default to something sensible when they cannot be sensibly executed}
      \paragraph{What that default action is}
      
    \subsection{Ordering of cox actions and boat "reaction"}
      \paragraph{Ensuring that the cox cannot influence the boat too directly}
      \paragraph{Ensuring the boat's movement comes after the cox has execute his action to ensure response}
      \paragraph{Dealing with actions that take multiply timesteps}
